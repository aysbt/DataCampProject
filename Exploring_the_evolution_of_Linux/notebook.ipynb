Pragmatic Programmers, 2018.\n\n**Christian Bird**, Tim Menzies, Thomas Zimmermann: The Art and Science of Analyzing Software Data. Morgan Kaufmann, 2015.\n\n**Tim Menzies**, Laurie Williams, Thomas Zimmermann: Perspectives on Data Science for Software Engineering. Morgan Kaufmann, 2016.\n\n####Reproducibility\nThanks to platforms like GitHub or SourceForge, it's easy to analyze the evolution of software projects nowadays. E. g. for this exercise, I cloned the whole Git repository of Linux (~3.6 GB) from GitHub. I copied the repository onto my hard drive with\n`git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git`\n\nand (after a few minutes of downloading) exported the history of the relevant information with\n\n`git log --encoding=latin-1 --pretty=\"%at#%aN\"`\n\nthat printed out the commit timestamp and the author. Be sure to set an encoding explicitly and to select a separator that doesn't occur in the data.\n\nNote: In rare cases, you'll need to use a non-printable character as separator. I found the \"DEVICE CONTROL TWO\" Unicode character U+0012 very useful for this purpose.\n\n##### Next Steps\nThere are many more parameters you can use with the --pretty option of git log. Have a look at the Git documentation for more details.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Linux kernel development in general, you can dive into the official documentation and start contributing to one of the most biggest open-source projects ever! :-)","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"60"}}}],"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"file_extension":".py","name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"},"mimetype":"text/x-python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.5.2","pygments_lexer":"ipython3"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3","language":"python"}},"nbformat":4}
